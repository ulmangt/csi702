host functions cannot be called from device code -- means none of c standard libraries are available to cuda
makes code reuse very difficult
forced implemenation of linear congruential random number generator


hard to write clean code because of reuse limitations

learning how to properly decompose code is hard -- similar to issues with cell -- you're writing and compiling in 2 languages -- makes build process difficult

Error: External calls are not supported (found non-inlined call to _Z12device_frandiff)
(device functions called from kernel are inlined, semantics on what is able to be inlined is unclear -- does this mean code has to be in a single file?)

(example of old guides, even a year old compilers and libries have changed)


making makefile portable hard -- sdk examples provide build scripts, but they are overly complicated for simple purposes (or for learning the libraries/build path) they present too many options/configurability at once
