== Compiling ==
===============

Open a command prompt and type:

make

This will generate three executables in the bin directory.


===============
== Running   ==
===============

Open a command prompt and type:

bin/nbody_gen_particles

This will generate data input files named particleXX.


To run the serial code type:

bin/nbody_serial

The maximum and minimum potentials will be printed and the potentials for all the particles saved to a file named "potential".


To run the parallel code type:

mpirun -np XX bin/nbody_parallel

XX should generally be equal to the number of particleXX files generated using nbody_gen_particles. The number of particle files generated is defined by NUM_PROC in hdr/nbody_util.h

The maximum and minimum potentials will be printed and the potentials for all the particles saved to a file named "potential_parallel".
