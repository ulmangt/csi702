== Running   ==
===============

Open a command prompt and type:

bin/nbody_gen_particles

This will generate data input files named particleXX.


To run the serial code type:

bin/nbody_serial

The maximum and minimum potentials will be printed and the potentials for all the particles saved to a file named "potential".


To run the parallel code type:

mpirun -np 10 bin/nbody_parallel

The maximum and minimum potentials will be printed and the potentials for all the particles saved to a file named "potential_parallel".
