============================
= Compilation Instructions =
============================

To compile, simply type:

make

This should create two executables, mandelbrot_serial and mandelbrot_threaded

To remove compiled files type:

make clean


==========================
= Running   Instructions =
==========================

To run mandelbrot_serial with default parameters, type:

./mandelbrot_serial

To adjust the run parameters, type:

./mandelbrot_serial [n] [itmax] [printResults]

n -- the size of the output array
itmax -- the maximum Julia set iterations
printResults -- 1 prints output to file, 0 suppresses output

For example:

./mandelbrot_serial 256 2000 0

Will run the code with a 256 by 256 output array, with 2000 iterations maximum per cell, and no output file will be generated.


To run mandelbrot_threaded with default parameters, type:

./mandelbrot_threaded

To adjust the run parameters, type:

./mandelbrot_threaded [numThreads] [n] [itmax] [printResults]

numThreads -- the number of threads to create. rows of the array will be divided evenly among the threads

For example:

./mandelbrot_threaded 32 512 20000 1

Will run the code with 32 threads, a 512 by 512 output array (with 16 rows being processed by each thread), with 20000 iterations maximum per cell, and will generate an mset output file.


==========================
= Note on Alternate Code =
==========================

As described in the report, an alternate threaded code was written to test a hypothesis about the performance degredation observed for long runs of the code. This code is not compiled by default, but can be compiled if desired using:

make mandelbrot_threaded_alternative
